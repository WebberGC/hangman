<h1>Hangman</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
This is a recreation of the well-known game, Hangman. The premise behind this game is for one person to come up with a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other to guess it by coming up with letters that could be in the word or phrase within a specified number of guesses. This is a simple terminal game written in the Python language.

<h3>Future Updates</h3>
Learning web scraping would allow me to replace theÂ hard-coded list of words, or I could store the terms in a database to make the code less "clunky."  I also intend to refactor and enhance the code using the information I've gained since completing the project.
